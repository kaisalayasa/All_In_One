
This project is meant to showcase some of my progress while learning React.  
I focused on practicing core concepts such as:

- Making a slick and clean design
- Documenting the learnings from each mini-project
- Working with third-party libraries
- Passing props and functions between components
- Organizing the project and following best practices for file structure
- Dynamic rendering and state management

I used **Vercel** to deploy the project online.
